# IP addresses that the lancache monolithic instance is reachable on
# Specify one or more IPs, space separated - these will be used when resolving
# DNS hostnames through lancachenet-dns. Multiple IPs can improve cache priming
# performance for some services (e.g. Steam)
# Note: This setting only affects DNS, monolithic and sniproxy will still bind
# to all IPs by default

# Change this to customise the size of the disk cache (default 2000000m)
# If you have more storage, you'll likely want to increase this

# Set this to a little bit less than your actual available space
